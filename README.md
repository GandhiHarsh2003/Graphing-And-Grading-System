# Grading System and Averaging Graphs
Built a program for the teachers to improve the grading system. In this program teachers would be able to keep track 
of their students test average. They can also compare which students are doing well in the class and which ones are struggling.
To make this program,  we built two data structures from scratch. We used jmathio.jar and jmathplot.jar Libraries to read in the input data 
and present the graph according to the data. We also added additional components which let teachers print multiple students average on one graph 
and see how the overall class is performing on the tests.

## Environment requirements for running project
Minimum Java 1.8 required

## How to run
Clone the project and press the start button. It will give you two options, either see the test graphs or either put in the test grades. You will need to put in a file name, so you can use the file on github and run the project.
